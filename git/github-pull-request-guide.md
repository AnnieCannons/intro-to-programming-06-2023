# How To Open A Pull Request To Turn In Your Assignments

- Navigate in your browser to the repo of **your fork** on GitHub. Be sure that the web address you're at has **your username** in it.
- **Click on the "Contribute" menu**. It should be to the right of text that says "This branch is [some number] commits ahead of AnnieCannons:main."
- A menu should drop down with an "Open pull request" button. **Click on that button.**
- On the next page, **click on "Create pull request"**.
- **Turn in** the assignment using **the URL from the page you are now at**. It should be `https://www.github.com/AnnieCannons/[name of assignment]/pull/[a number]`. If it does _not_ have that basic form, **check the previous steps**. Most likely, you skipped the step just before this!
