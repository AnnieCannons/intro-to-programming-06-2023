# Git Solo Exercise - Prepping To Interview Someone

In this assignment, you'll **write questions** as if you were **interviewing a peer**.

More importantly, you'll **practice your Git and GitHub skills**.

## Learning Objectives

After this assignment, students will be able to:

- Edit a file with Visual Studio Code.
- Have some familiarity with Git.
- Have some familiarity with GitHub.
- **Use** (but **not** memorize) the basic Git workflow.
- Push their changes to GitHub.

## Instructions

1. Create a repository on GitHub. Initialize it as a public repo **without** a readme or license. This is the default, so go right from naming he repo to clicking "Create repository".
2. On your local machine, in the **terminal**, **create** a directory and **navigate** into it. Preferably this should be in a special folder for dev work—we usually recommend putting work in `~/Documents/dev`.
3. Initialize it as a git repository with `git init`.
4. Create a file called `readme.md`—`touch` is a good command to use, here.
5. **Open the file or directory in Visual Studio Code**. If you have the `code` command set up, you can simply run `code .` to open the current directory in VSC—`.` is a shortcut in the terminal for the current directory
	- If you opened the whole directory, now open the `readme.md` file in VS Code—a good tool for this is the shortcut Command-p, which will let you type in the name of any file in your current project to open it or switch to it.
6. Give the document the title, "Questions For An AnnieCannons Student". If you want it to appear as a big heading on GitHub, add a `# ` to the start, so that the title is "# Questions For An AnnieCannons Student"
