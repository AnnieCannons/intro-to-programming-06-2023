# JavaScript Module

## Introduction to JavaScript, DevTools, Variables and Data Types
### The Why: With just HTML and CSS, websites would be static and have no functionality or ability to respond to data. JavaScript is a programming language that gives developers the tools to make sites dynamic and responsive to user’s actions. JS allows companies to collect data from users.

- Learning Objectives:
    - Understand what problem(s) JavaScript was invented to solve
    - Understand JS + ECMAScript, and that it changes constantly
    - Know how to open the console in the dev tools and how to run basic console.log functions
    - Understand what a variable is, how to declare one, how to reassign a variable’s value, and how to use the data in other places in your project
    - Understand the difference between let, var, and const
    - Basic understanding of the five data types
    - Learn to declare and assign values to variables of different data types.
    - Explore the behavior and characteristics of each data type in JavaScript.
    - Learn to perform operations and manipulations specific to each data type.

## JS Functions and Scope, Lecture and Lab
### The Why: With the size of websites expanding and the increase in the amount of data being used to power sites, developers need to be able to write modular, reusable, and efficient code. Function are tools that make your program easier to understand, more efficient, and more secure.

- Learning Objectives:
    - Understand the concept and purpose of functions in JavaScript.
    - Recognize the syntax for declaring and defining functions.
    - Learn how to call or invoke functions and pass arguments.
    - Understand the concept of parameters and how to use them in functions.
    - Learn the concept of return values and how to use them effectively.
    - Learn about function expressions and their differences compared to function declarations.
    - Understand the scope of variables within functions.
    - Explore best practices for writing clean, modular, and reusable functions.
    - Gain practical experience by solving coding problems and implementing functions in projects.
    - Develop the ability to analyze and understand code snippets involving functions.

    - Unit 4: [Scope Exercises](https://github.com/AnnieCannons/js-function-scope)


## JS Conditionals and Loops, Lecture and Lab
### The Why: For many programs, there need to be different experiences or data for users depending on certain conditions. Conditionals give flexibility into programs. When working with large data sets or large numbers of users, developers need to be able to run repetitive tasks without having to write the same code over and over. Loops make programs more efficient and require developers to write less code.

- Learning Objectives:
    - Understand the concept and purpose of conditional statements and loops in programming.
    - Learn the syntax and usage of if statements to make decisions based on conditions.
    - Understand the else statement and else-if clause to handle multiple branching conditions.
    - Familiarize yourself with comparison operators and logical operators for condition evaluation.
    - Learn the syntax and usage of for loops for repetitive tasks.
    - Familiarize yourself with looping over arrays using for loops and array iteration methods.
    - Learn to loop over object properties using for...in loop and iterate over array-like objects.
    - Gain practical experience through solving coding problems involving conditional statements and loops.

## DOM, Templates, and Data/Forms, Lecture and Lab
### The Why: Developers need a way to use JavaScript to access static and dynamic content on a web page or in a web app. The DOM provides a standardized way to interact with HTML documents and dynamically manipulate web content. JavaScript allows you to listen for events, such as button clicks or form submissions, and perform actions based on those events, dynamically updating the content or behavior of the web page.
- Learning Objectives:
    - Understand the role and purpose of the DOM in web development.
    - Learn the structure of the DOM tree and its relationship with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    - Learn methods to access and manipulate DOM elements using different selection techniques.
    - Understand how to modify element properties, attributes, and data dynamically.
    - Learn to handle DOM events and add event listeners to elements.
    - Understand DOM traversal techniques to navigate and manipulate elements within the DOM tree.
    - Familiarize yourself with dynamic content updates using HTML templates and cloning techniques.
    - Learn to work with forms, access form elements, and handle form submission.
    - Understand techniques for manipulating CSS classes and inline styles of DOM elements.
    - Develop skills in handling form validation and data validation using JavaScript.
